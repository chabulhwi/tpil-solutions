# tpil-solutions

This is the repository for my solutions to the exercises in ["Theorem Proving in
Lean 4][tpil] by [Jeremy Avigad][ja], [Leonardo de Moura][ldm], [Soonho
Kong][sk] and [Sebastian Ullrich][su], with contributions from the [Lean
Community][lean-comm]. You are free to reuse the content under the terms of
[Apache License Version 2.0](./LICENSE).

I've also included in this repository a quiz for each chapter of the text and my
solutions to the questions of each quiz.
